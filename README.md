# Arithmetic Problems Dataset

This repository provides a Python script for generating arithmetic problems and creating datasets. The dataset includes problems with varying levels of difficulty and supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can also generate problems involving decimal numbers. The script is based on an [original implementation](https://github.com/maxwbuckley/r2ltokenizing/blob/main/llmarithmetic.py) with custom modifications.

## Features

- Supports arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
- Configurable problem generation, including range of numbers and inclusion of decimals
- Generates datasets with different levels of difficulty
- Configurable rounding precision and number formatting (commas for thousands)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `datasets` library from Hugging Face
- `PyYAML` for handling configurations
